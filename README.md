## Helloooo! ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently obsessively learning some new data things - **D3**, data **engineering**, enhanced data visualization **UI** and **interactivity**, and better **storytelling**.

Current and past work includes analytics work in Product, Sales, Marketing, Finance, SaaS, and eCommerce, specializing in **a/b Testing**, a lot of **Tableau**, **Looker** and **LookML**, **SQL**, and some **front-end** development.
